## Overview

A fun and light-hearted platformer that aims to be a true glu-ten out of ten. You must get to the goal 
with nothing but your skill and patience as you try to progress through a world where fighting back is 
not an option for you, but hey, at yeast you’ve got legs. Any character additions or modifiers will 
come strictly through the levels, no shops or money systems as frankly you don’t have the time or 
resources to make any dough. Rye-s to the occasion and get back what was wrongfully taken from 
you, but most of all have fun, no-one likes a sourdough.
